# Planning of showcase game 

### elements covered in showcase 
1. backend [nodeJs] 
2. database [mongoDB]
3. frontend UI [react]
4. multiplayer [p2p webRTC]
5. game 

#### backend 
the backend needs to serve the game files, handle authentication
and help with initiate connection

#### database 
storing user information, game scores, friends etc 

#### frontend UI 
the frontend needs a UI for login/register 
game room where the list of friends is shown (online friends etc)
adding new friends as well, and finally access the actual game.
Make sure that client is using chrome since its the safest option to make sure all is working (and non mobile)

#### multiplayer 
webrtc will be used for the real time comunication, handeling all the in-game events 

#### game 
runs on chrome, non-mobile 
leaving this blank for now
